# file: hangman.py is a program that users can play the game hangman by trying to guess the word 
the computer gives. There are restricted number of lives and certain word size
'''
# input: Inputs that are given by the user are word size and #of lives initially and then letters to guess the word, user chooses whether to restart the game
# output: Output the number of lives, whether the letter is correct or incorrect, restarts the game if user wants that

#Initial print statements
print("Welcome to the Hangman Game!")
